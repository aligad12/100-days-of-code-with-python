# 🃏 Blackjack Game (Python Console Version)

A simple command-line Blackjack game built with Python! You play against a computer dealer in a classic card showdown. Try to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. Can you beat the dealer?

---

## 🎮 Features

- Simulates a real Blackjack experience with simple rules.
- Computer follows basic Blackjack logic: hits until 17+.
- Handles Ace card flexibly as 1 or 11 depending on hand.
- Clear visual output of cards and results.
- ASCII art intro for visual flair.

---

## 🧠 Game Rules

- Each player (you and the dealer) starts with 2 cards.
- "Normal" cards are 2–10.
- Face cards (K, Q, J) are worth 10.
- Aces can be 1 or 11, depending on what helps you more.
- You can draw more cards (`deal`) or stop drawing (`n`).
- If your total goes over 21, you **bust** and lose.
- The dealer draws until their total is at least 17.
- Highest hand under or equal to 21 wins.
